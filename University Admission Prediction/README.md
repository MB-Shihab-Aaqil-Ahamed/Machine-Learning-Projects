## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to build a regression model to predict the chance of admission into a particular university based on the student's profile. The inputs or features for the model include GRE Scores, TOEFL Scores, University Rating, Statement of Purpose (SOP), Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strength, Undergraduate GPA, and Research Experience (0 or 1). The output of the model will be the chance of admission, which will be a value ranging from 0 to 1.

Dataset Overview
Dataset: Graduate Admissions Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Metrics: 500 rows, 9 columns
About: The graduate studies dataset is a dataset which describes the acceptance probability of a student based on the following parameters:
1. GRE Score (out of 340)
2. TOEFL Score (out of 120)
3. IELTS Score (out of 9)
4. University Rating (out of 5)
5. Statement of Purpose/ SOP (out of 5)
6. Letter of Recommendation/ LOR (out of 5)
7. Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
8. Chance of Admittance (ranging from 0 to 1)

## Project Objectives
1. To understand regression and classification problems and their application in university admission prediction.
2. To gain insights from data through exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques.
3. To apply different machine learning algorithms, including Multiple Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Decision Tree Regressors, to determine the probability of acceptance in a particular university.
4. To evaluate the performance of the regression models using relevant metrics.
5. To create a web application using the Flask framework to showcase the admission prediction model.
