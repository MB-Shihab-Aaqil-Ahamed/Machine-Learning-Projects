## Diabetes Predictor

The Diabetes Predictor project is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various features such as Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI. The project covers all the steps from data gathering to model deployment.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:

- To predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
- To compare various machine learning algorithms and find the best one based on the accuracy_score metric.
- To create a web app using Flask, which is a Python micro-framework.

## Steps Involved

The project involves the following steps:

- Data gathering: The first step is to gather the data required for the project. This could involve collecting data from various sources or using an existing dataset.
- Data preprocessing: The collected data is then preprocessed to clean and transform it into a suitable format for machine learning models.
- Feature engineering: This step involves selecting and creating features that are most relevant for the prediction task.
- Model training: Several machine learning algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data, and their performance is evaluated using the accuracy_score metric.
- Model deployment: The best-performing model is then deployed and integrated into a web app using Flask.

## How to Use

To use the Diabetes Predictor app, follow these steps:

- Install the required libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the app.py file to start the Flask server.
- Open the web app on your browser and enter the required inputs for prediction.

## Conclusion

The Diabetes Predictor project showcases a complete end-to-end machine learning project, covering all the necessary steps from data gathering to model deployment. The project uses various machine learning algorithms and compares them based on the accuracy_score metric to find the best-performing one. The web app created using Flask allows users to easily use the trained model for diabetes prediction.
